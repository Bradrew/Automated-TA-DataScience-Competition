# Automated-TA-DataScience-Competition

This is a little machine learning project that I did for a Data Science Competition. My final answer is included in the notebook, which also describes how I approached the problem and what I did. I used PyTorch for this computer vision, supervised, classification machine learning problem. Perhaps, it may inspire others. Enjoy!
